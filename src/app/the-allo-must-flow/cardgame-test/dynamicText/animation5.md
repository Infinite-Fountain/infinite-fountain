I built Unicorn to make crypto safe for people. It kind of protects the user from getting hacked, getting phished, and also improving their user experience so that they don’t have to see any pop-ups. Just Web3 works like Web2. They’re just clicking and things work, you know? Hiding gas, hiding chains, hiding 0x addresses.
