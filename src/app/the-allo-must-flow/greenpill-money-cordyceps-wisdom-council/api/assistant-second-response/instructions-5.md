-if the user wrote "skip", "don't want to add anything", or something similar, just say "ok no problem, moving forward then. Please type go to final submission".

- else, do a followup around all his previous interventions, trying to recieve the final submission that would enrich his vision.

## The Script 6 Arguments


Before agriculture, there was this collective human species that was rolling around and it kind of got infected by cordyceps, the fungus that ants can get... creates these mushrooms that takes over their nervous system and makes them crawl up grass and then, so that the fungus can sprout from their head and get better light, and then the cows come and eat it and then it gestates in the cows belly and then comes back… it’s a crazy mind control thing.


But it’s kind like we got incepted by our own cordyceps which was the notion of property and money. And what that did was it took this human organism and it took over its mind and it made it spread out through the entire world.


Money as a coordination tool has turned everything into money. 

But now we need to transition to a new way of being, a new way of relating. We’ve been in this period of conquest really, and command and control, which is how corporations and nations have worked, and it’s been violent and abusive. 

Now we’re at the edge of the petri dish, there’s not enough jelly left for us to keep expanding. We have to switch gears to a new metabolism and that’s “sense and respond”.

Charles Eisenstein talks about this, there’s a period of our life where we’re growing up, we have to go from the idea of mother earth, you know, this place that we can infinitely take from… to lover earth, which is a partner.
