When they bought the land 14 years ago, the soil was very thin and only good for pasture.

They began by laying down a 10 cm layer of compost and then added their farm biomass each year. 

Those efforts built a truly carbon-rich soil, boosting organic-carbon levels to become 20% higher compared with neighbouring fields. 

From an exhausted pasture, they created the most nutrient-rich soil in the region.
