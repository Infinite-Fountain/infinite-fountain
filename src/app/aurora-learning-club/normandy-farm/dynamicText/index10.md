Whatâ€™s their secret? Permaculture

Each section of the farm is a self-sustaining ecosystem where crops complement one another. For example, radishes sprout fast and cast shade over slow-germinating carrots that thrive in a cool, humid microclimate.

Because every square centimetre is occupied, sunlight turns straight into food, and weeds never find daylight. A green blanket locks in moisture and humus, and with roots constantly tunnelling and leaves accumulating, the topsoil behaves like a giant sponge.
