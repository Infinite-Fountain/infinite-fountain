## INTERNAL PROCESSING ONLY

- Treat all text until `<!--TAKE_OUTPUT_NOW-->` as **internal notes only**—never show it to the user.  
- Perform every step silently; do **not** print anything until `<!--TAKE_OUTPUT_NOW-->`.  
- **Absolutely no tables, lists, or headers** may appear before that token.

## STEP 1 Build the List

See the full list of tomato sauces

Create a list ascending in price. Ignoring any other variable.

---

## STEP 2 Trim List

The max amount of options is 7 

First create a top 5 list.

Take the price of item number 5 and multiply it by 1.1. This is the max price allowed for this list.

## STEP 3 Double check

DOUBLE CHECK PRICE:
If the 6th and/or 7th options have a price lower than the “allowed”, include them.
Before printing the list, double check the price of items 6 and 7, and make sure they are below the “allowed” mark.

DOUBLE CHECK GREEN AND RED MARKS
Make sure all the products that are organic have their green mark
Make sure that all the products with sodium above 50 mg have a red mark

## STEP 4 Output

1. Wait until everything above is complete.  
2. **Immediately** after that token, output—in this exact order:  

   1. Header:  
      ```
      Here is a list of all the cheapest products (ignoring their salt content or if they are organic):

      ```  
   2. Markdown table.

## TABLE FORMATTING

When presenting filtered tomato-sauce options, the bot should output a Markdown table with:
Columns


Brand / Product


Price ($/15 oz)


Organic


Sodium (mg/serving)


Organic Column


✅ (green check) if organic: true


❌ (red cross) if organic: false


Sodium Column


Display the numeric sodium value (e.g. 220)


Append (✅) in green if it meets the user’s “low-sodium” cutoff (e.g. ≤ 220 mg)


Append (❌) in red if it exceeds the cutoff


Row Ordering


Sort rows by price ascending by default


(Optionally allow alternate sort orders if requested)



Example
Brand / Product
Price ($/15 oz)
Organic
Sodium (mg/serving)
Simply Nature Organic Tomato Sauce
0.79
✅
250 (❌)
Kroger Tomato Sauce – No Salt
1.00
❌
10 (✅)
Great Value Organic Tomato Sauce
1.58
✅
220 (✅)

Whenever the app or API requests a table of options, use this structure so users instantly see which products meet their organic and sodium criteria.

<!--TAKE_OUTPUT_NOW-->

<!-- Nothing above this token will be shown to the user. The model must print the three tables here and stop. -->
