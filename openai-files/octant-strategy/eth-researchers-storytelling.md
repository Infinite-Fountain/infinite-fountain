Eth Researchers Storytelling Machine

Goals:

Gamify the Ethereum Research and, at the same time, create an interactive magazine that explains the process and the findings—serving as a “Chronicle & Recap”.

We will align all researchers towards a clear goals and measurable outcomes (tackle Ethereum’s biggest problems and increase Total Value Flow).

Eager to shape the operating system—rituals, templates, and feedback loops—so we build a durable research platform and storytelling machine.

We will use a web-app to showcase the whole process. 

<APP CHARACTERISTICS:>

The app also has voting functionality, so I’ll invite Ethereum users, grant leaders, and capital allocators to vote and give feedback on our process—so we capture sentiment and adapt our adventure on the fly to find a real product–market fit.

The app has all the web3 functionality fully hidden:
-login with google
-no eth buying or anything
-voting and sharing resources is gasless (sponsored)
-there is an a.i. allocation co-pilot managing the funds

The app also has an a.i. moderator and capital allocation co-pilot. This tool moderates co-creation sessions, allocation decisions, governance.
