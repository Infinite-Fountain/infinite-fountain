# Gamechangers: Resilience Fanzine & Online Workshops


# Impact Squads: Local Storytellers with Independent Socialmedia Handles, Resilience Magazine & Online Workshops

## POSSIBLE NAMES
Impact Squads  
Small Wins  
Gamechangers Magazine

These names can co-exist with clear roles across the stack:
- **Impact Squads** → the crews that run local workshops and manage a single topic channel.
- **Small Wins** → the network of **DAO-owned social handles** (our outward-facing brand for Web2 reach).
- **Gamechangers Magazine** → the formal publication that curates the best work across handles (less normie, more ETH-centric features and deep dives).

## Intro
Gamechangers reimagines local media as a **fanzine + workshop ecosystem** that pays people to showcase their neighbors’ wins and fund quick fixes everyone cares about—park cleanups, safety zines, price-watch reports. Each city has a paid **Coach** who runs lightweight online jams and monthly publishing sprints. Residents receive a fixed monthly **Pocket** of votes to back stories, guides, and tiny fix-projects; under the hood these votes route to **gasless quadratic budgets** and **sponsored pools**, so winners earn USDC and visibility without touching crypto.

To make distribution real (and measurable), channels are **DAO-owned social handles**, each focused on a **specific topic cluster** (e.g., Street Safety, Food Resilience, Climate, Youth Work). Every handle is mirrored as a **subdomain or folder** on the app (e.g., `safety.smallwins.app` or `app/handles/safety`) so posts always link back to our hub. **Squads can join exactly one handle** (focus and craft depth), and they **co-create and manage** that handle with a rotating **Handle Steward**. We intentionally keep a strong **Web2 presence** (shorts/reels/threads) to reach people outside the web3 bubble—while all traffic is funneled back to the app for voting, payouts, and transparency.

All web3 complexity stays invisible: Google login, no buys, frictionless payments. An **AI copilot** nudges creators with prompts, routes submissions, and generates recap reels. Normie hook: purpose, side-income, and local pride—delivered through transparent community budgets, not jargon.

## How It Works
1. **Recruit & Kickoff** — Coach spins up a city Crew; login via Google/social only.  
2. **Choose a Handle (Topic Channel)** — Squad commits to **one DAO-owned handle** that matches its niche. A short “Handle Sprint” locks **audience, tone, and OKRs** (cadence, click-through to app, voters activated, USDC paid).  
3. **Mini-Publishing Sprint (4 weeks)** — Weekly jam → publish local stories/guides through the handle; posts auto-mirror to the handle’s app page for voting and payouts.  
4. **Voting “Pocket”** — Every resident gets a monthly Pocket (gasless QV) to back pieces and quick-win proposals; votes attribute to the **origin handle** for growth rewards.  
5. **Sponsored Pools** — Topic-aligned sponsors fund **handle-level pools** (e.g., Safety Pool), plus city/general pools.  
6. **Payouts** — Top content and fix-projects earn USDC + featured placement in **Gamechangers Magazine** and handle leaderboards.  
7. **Do & Document** — Crews execute funded “small wins,” post proof, and ship how-to templates via the handle.  
8. **Stewardship & Governance** — Handle Stewards run the editorial calendar, meet monthly for peer review, rotate each season; the DAO controls ownership and posting keys.  
9. **Global Council** — Anyone worldwide can vote, **sponsor and earn**, and amplify the best city stories; cross-handle showcases fuel friendly rivalry.  
10. **Distribution** — Clips and threads publish to the **Web2 handle** and always point back to the app handle page; UTM + ref tracking power **growth pool** rewards.  
11. **Replication** — The “Coach + Handle Steward Kit” (playbooks, templates, prompts) spins up the next handle or neighborhood Crew once KPIs are met.

## Roles
- **Coach (paid):** Hosts jams, curates, verifies proof-of-work, runs payouts, builds partnerships, and mentors Handle Stewards.  
- **Handle Steward (paid micro-business role):** Leads **one** handle’s editorial calendar and community, manages contributors, tracks OKRs, and owns sponsor relations; term-limited with peer review.  
- **Impact Squad (contributors):** Writers, videographers, mappers, data-checkers, fix-project leads—**bound to one handle** for focus; limited “guest collabs” allowed for cross-pollination.  
- **Residents (voters):** Spend the Pocket on what matters locally; can follow handles and receive topic digests.  
- **Sponsors/Partners:** Seed **handle-level and city-level pools**, receive transparent impact reports and showcase rights.  
- **Global Council:** Anyone worldwide can vote, **sponsor and earn**, and help surface the best outputs across handles.

## Incentives & Budgets
- **USDC Micro-grants:** Content bounties + “Do” bounties for quick wins; sized per handle maturity and city priorities.  
- **Gasless QV:** The Pocket hides all crypto complexity; monthly reset.  
- **Handle Growth Pool (Attribution-based):** A shared reward pot splits by **traffic-to-voters-to-payouts** attributed to each handle (UTM/referrer on every post).  
- **Micro-P&L per Handle:** Open-books dashboard tracks sponsor income, QV inflows, creator payouts, and cost-per-outcome; Stewards earn a base stipend + performance kicker.  
- **Visibility Rewards:** Handle leaderboards + the “Hall of Wins”; top pieces syndicated in **Gamechangers Magazine**.  
- **Sponsor & Earn (Global):** Backers fund pools and earn a return = *(their share of support) × (handle/team performance vs. the network)*—aligning discovery, impact, and growth.  
- **Guest Collab Allowance:** Guardrails permit limited cross-posting between handles without diluting focus; collab metrics split by agreed formula.

## Tech Stack
- **Login & Payments:** Google/social; PayPal/Apple Pay/Google Pay/credit card on-ramp—converted to USDC invisibly.  
- **Voting:** Gas-sponsored quadratic budgets; monthly Pocket reset; **per-handle** attribution on spend.  
- **Handles & Routing:** Each handle has a **subdomain or folder** on the app; canonical links ensure all Web2 posts route users back to the corresponding app page for voting and payouts.  
- **Transparency:** On-chain proofs for pools and payouts, framed as “community budgets,” with **handle-level dashboards** (OKRs, P&L, funded wins, cost-per-outcome).  
- **Governance:** DAO multisig owns handles and subdomains; **scoped posting keys** for stewards; seasonal elections/rotation; incident off-boarding.  
- **AI Copilot:** Prompt packs by handle (style, myth-busting, explainer scripts), auto-routing to pools, recap reels, moderation assist.  
- **Analytics & Attribution:** UTM/ref capture on every post → **growth pool** calculation, cohort reports, and retention by handle.  
- **Web2 Connectors:** Native publishing to Shorts/Reels/TikTok/X/FB with link-back and preview cards; comment ingestion for feedback loops.
