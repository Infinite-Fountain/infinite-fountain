Ikigai Microbusiness with automated community pool

We are looking for people that:
-are changemakers
-love sharing
-resilient
-get things done

We will give them a side-hustle:

-very well paid (hourly, 20% above market average)
-related to a micro-business that is highly alligned with something they truly care about and has a strong social or environmental impact, giving them purpose and extra income.
-involves using an app to coordinate a tiny community to co-create the business, vote, and share a community pool

## Tech Stack
- **Login & Payments:** Google/social; PayPal/Apple Pay/Google Pay/credit card on-ramp—converted to USDC invisibly.  
- **Voting:** Gas-sponsored quadratic budgets; monthly Pocket reset; **per-handle** attribution on spend.  
- **Handles & Routing:** Each handle has a **subdomain or folder** on the app; canonical links ensure all Web2 posts route users back to the corresponding app page for voting and payouts.  
- **Transparency:** On-chain proofs for pools and payouts, framed as “community budgets,” with **handle-level dashboards** (OKRs, P&L, funded wins, cost-per-outcome).  
- **Governance:** DAO multisig owns handles and subdomains; **scoped posting keys** for stewards; seasonal elections/rotation; incident off-boarding.  
- **AI Copilot:** Prompt packs by handle (style, myth-busting, explainer scripts), auto-routing to pools, recap reels, moderation assist.  
- **Analytics & Attribution:** UTM/ref capture on every post → **growth pool** calculation, cohort reports, and retention by handle.  
- **Web2 Connectors:** Native publishing to Shorts/Reels/TikTok/X/FB with link-back and preview cards; comment ingestion for feedback loops.
