Celo and Gitcoin
Ethereum for the world

this grant program will be looking for projects that either:

apply Ethereum (especially L2s) to SDG-aligned, real-world use cases like digital identity, humanitarian aid tracking, last-mile funding, supply chain traceability, climate action, or financial inclusion

are at the “Idea,” “Pilot,” or MVP stage where open-source, onchain infrastructure and the developer ecosystem can deliver the most value

demonstrate non-speculative usage (transactions, users, smart-contract activity) and publish impact reports aligned with SDGs and CIDS

integrate with—or are ready to integrate with—development-aid pipelines (e.g., UNDP Blockchain Accelerator) and trusted institutional partners

leverage quadratic and impact-based funding (e.g., Karma, Prosperity Pass) and contribute to mechanism innovation and impact transparency

are open-source, user-facing solutions that expand the base beyond crypto-native participants and strengthen Ethereum’s role as the “world ledger”

show strong capital efficiency and co-funding or coordination with aligned actors (e.g., Gitcoin, Celo, Ethereum Foundation, Optimism, Giveth, UNICEF, UNDP)

support builder retention and lifecycle depth (e.g., progressing across Gitcoin rounds such as GG24 → GG25)

produce thought leadership and ecosystem legitimacy through community engagement, partner co-definition, and visible results
