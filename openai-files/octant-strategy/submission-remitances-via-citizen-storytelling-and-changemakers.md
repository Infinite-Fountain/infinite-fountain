Remitances and gobal mutal aid via citizen storytelling and changemakers

CONTEXT
remitances normally:
-are between family members
-sent as a support or mutual aid
-using expensive services with high fees

We will build a global citizen storytelling fanzine. 

Its a space for everyhuman to report whatever he wants from the trenches.
-any motivational thing that happened in his city
-changemakers case studies
-grassroots activities with social or environmental impact
-local news (citizen journalism)

sponsors will create contests and put matching pools to incentives participants.

people can do 2 things after seeing a content:
-vote on a scale of 1 to 5 (have cetain amount of available votes per week), this enables quadratic voting to distribute the matching funds
-send a tip that also serves as a "bet" on the individual (we will not say bet to avoid legal problems). but its a "vote and earn" deal.

there will be a lot of "sponsored pools" so if users vote on the favorite ideas, they will win a percentage of the pool, depending on how much they staked on it vs the rest. its like polymarket or jokerace (vote-and-earn v2). please research about it. 

but overall, its is like having a "global remitances system and a mutual aid system"

everything is sent in eth or usdc. we will onboard the masses.




<APP CHARACTERISTICS:>

The app also has voting functionality, so I’ll invite Ethereum users, grant leaders, and capital allocators to vote and give feedback on our process—so we capture sentiment and adapt our adventure on the fly to find a real product–market fit.

The app has all the web3 functionality fully hidden:
-login with google
-no eth buying or anything
-voting and sharing resources is gasless (sponsored)
-there is an a.i. allocation co-pilot managing the funds

The app also has an a.i. moderator and capital allocation co-pilot. This tool moderates co-creation sessions, allocation decisions, governance.
