# Impact Guilds: SB+CC (Small Business + Community Council)

---

## Intro
Impact Guilds turn local changemakers into **Coach-operators** of a **Small Business + Community Council (SB+CC)**.  
Each SB+CC sells **valuable products/services** (workshops, audits, guides, kits) and runs **regular meetups** that document and fund **SDG-aligned quick wins**.  

Residents get a free monthly **Pocket of votes** (gasless QV). **Receipts unlock bonus votes** (1 vote per 1 USD spent with the SB), aligning commerce with community priorities—without feeling like “crypto.”  
Google login, card/PayPal on-ramp to USDC, and clear dashboards keep it normie-friendly.  
An **AI copilot** assists with prompts, moderation, and recap reels.

## How It Works
1. **Recruit & Train Coaches**  
   We onboard resilient doers as Coach-operators. Training covers business basics, storytelling, facilitation, and governance.

2. **Spin up the SB+CC**  
   The Coach forms an SB (revenue lines & pricing) and a Community Council (advisory + oversight). Together they set a 90-day plan: products, SDG focus, and quick-win pipeline.

3. **Choose a Topic Handle (Small Wins)**  
   Each Guild selects one DAO-owned handle (e.g., Street Safety, Food Resilience). All posts mirror to the handle’s app page for voting, payouts, and transparency.

4. **Mini-Publishing & Action Sprints (4 weeks)**  
   Weekly jams produce stories, guides, and proposals. **Impact Squads** form to deliver small SDG milestones (cleanup, price-watch, climate hacks, local data).

5. **Pocket + Receipts → Votes**  
   - **Free Pocket:** every resident gets a monthly allocation of votes (gasless QV).  
   - **Bonus Votes:** 1 vote per 1 USD spent on SB+CC products/services; votes accrue in the app and attribute back to the origin handle.

6. **Pools & Payouts**  
   The SB+CC manages a community pool funded by sales, sponsors, local partners, and platform matching. Top-voted content and quick wins receive **USDC micro-grants**; creators and Squad leads are paid on proof.

7. **Do & Document**  
   Squads execute, post evidence, and publish “how-to” templates. The best work is featured in **Gamechangers Magazine**.

8. **Governance & Safety**  
   DAO multisig owns the handles; scoped posting keys for stewards; seasonal rotation and incident off-boarding.  
   AI-assisted moderation + transparent logs.

9. **Replication**  
   Once KPIs are hit, the Coach can spawn a new Squad or help a new Coach start another SB+CC with a **Starter Kit**.
