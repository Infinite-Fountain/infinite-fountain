# Impact Guilds: SB+CC (Small Business + Community Council)

---

## Intro
Impact Guilds turn local changemakers into **Coach-operators** of a **Small Business + Community Council (SB+CC)**.  
Each SB sells **valuable products/services** (workshops, audits, guides, kits) and runs **regular meetups** that document and fund **SDG-aligned quick wins**.  

Residents get a free monthly **Pocket of votes** (gasless QV). **Receipts unlock bonus votes** (1 vote per 1 USD spent with the SB), aligning commerce with community priorities—without feeling like “crypto.”  
Google login, card/PayPal on-ramp to USDC, and clear dashboards keep it normie-friendly.  
An **AI copilot** assists with prompts, moderation, and recap reels.

## How It Works
1. **Recruit & Train Coaches**  
   We onboard resilient doers as Coach-operators. Training covers business basics, storytelling, facilitation, and governance.

2. **Spin up the SB+CC**  
   The Coach forms an SB (revenue lines & pricing) and a Community Council (advisory + oversight). Together they set a 90-day plan: products, SDG focus, and quick-win pipeline.

3. **Choose a Topic Handle (Small Wins)**  
   Each Guild selects one DAO-owned handle (e.g., Street Safety, Food Resilience). All posts mirror to the handle’s app page for voting, payouts, and transparency.

4. **Mini-Publishing & Action Sprints (4 weeks)**  
   Weekly jams produce stories, guides, and proposals. **Impact Squads** form to deliver small SDG milestones (cleanup, price-watch, climate hacks, local data).

5. **Pocket + Receipts → Votes**  
   - **Free Pocket:** every resident gets a monthly allocation of votes (gasless QV).  
   - **Bonus Votes:** 1 vote per 1 USD spent on SB products/services; votes accrue in the app and attribute back to the origin handle.

6. **Pools & Payouts**  
   The SB+CC manages a community pool funded by sales, sponsors, local partners, and platform matching. Top-voted content and quick wins receive **USDC micro-grants**; creators and Squad leads are paid on proof.

7. **Do & Document**  
   Squads execute, post evidence, and publish “how-to” templates. The best work is featured in **Gamechangers Magazine**.

8. **Governance & Safety**  
   DAO multisig owns the handles; scoped posting keys for stewards; seasonal rotation and incident off-boarding.  
   AI-assisted moderation + transparent logs.

9. **Replication**  
   Once KPIs are hit, the Coach can spawn a new Squad or help a new Coach start another SB+CC with a **Starter Kit**.

## Roles
- **Coach-operator (paid):** Runs the SB, leads sessions, curates, verifies proof, does payouts, builds partners, and mentors a Handle Steward.  
- **Handle Steward (paid micro-business role):** Leads one handle’s editorial calendar, manages contributors, tracks OKRs, and manages sponsors; term-limited with peer review.  
- **Impact Squad (contributors):** Writers, videographers, mappers, data-checkers, fix-project leads—**bound to one handle** for focus (guest collabs allowed).  
- **Residents (voters/customers):** Receive a free Pocket; purchases unlock bonus votes; can follow handles and receive digests.  
- **Sponsors/Partners:** Seed pools, co-host events, and receive transparent impact reports and showcase rights.  
- **Global Council:** Signal, co-fund, and amplify the best outputs across handles.

## Incentives & Budgets
- **Micro-P&L per SB/Handle:** Open books dashboard shows revenue (sales, sponsors), QV inflows, creator payouts, and cost-per-outcome.  
- **USDC Micro-grants:** Content bounties + “Do” bounties sized by handle maturity; paid on proof.  
- **Gasless QV + Attribution:** Votes reset monthly; attribution by handle and by receipt.  
- **Handle Growth Pool:** Network-level bonus splits by traffic → voters → payouts attributed to each handle (UTM/referrer on every post).  
- **Visibility Rewards:** Leaderboards + Hall of Wins; top work syndicated in **Gamechangers Magazine**.  
- **Coach Compensation:** Base stipend + performance kicker (revenue, outcomes, retention).  
- **Sponsor-and-Earn (optional):** Backers fund pools and receive a return tied to their share × handle performance (clearly disclosed; off by default in early pilots).

## Tech Stack
- **Login & Payments:** Google/social; PayPal/Apple Pay/Google Pay/credit card on-ramp—auto-converted to USDC (no wallets required).  
- **Voting:** Gas-sponsored QV; free Pocket + receipt-bonus votes (1 USD = 1 vote); per-handle attribution; anti-abuse guardrails.  
- **Handles & Routing:** DAO-owned topic handles map to app subdomains/folders; canonical links route all Web2 posts back to the app.  
- **Transparency:** On-chain proofs for pools and payouts; handle-level dashboards with OKRs, P&L, funded wins, and outcomes.  
- **Governance:** DAO multisig owns handles; scoped posting keys; seasonal elections/rotation; incident off-boarding.  
- **AI Copilot:** Prompt packs per handle (scripts, myth-busting, explainer scaffolds), recap reels, moderation assist, routing to pools.  
- **Analytics:** UTM/ref capture on every post; cohort reports; “growth pool” calculation; retention by handle.  
- **Web2 Connectors:** Native publishing to Shorts/Reels/TikTok/X/FB with link-back previews; comment ingestion for feedback loops.
