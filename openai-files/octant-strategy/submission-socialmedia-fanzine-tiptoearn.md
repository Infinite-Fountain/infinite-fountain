Social Media Fanzine, tip to earn

will create a global app that:
-feels like social media (scrollable posts that you can like and follow)
-but the content is made by teams
-and you can "tip to earn" (and also just like)

fanzine so that the project starts digital. we will be organizing a lot of online workshops, where people will gather to co-create succesful fanzines that showcase ethereum projects that have given social or environmental impact. 

each hub (by city) will be run by a "coach" that will invite the community and give workshops and organize meetups. it will be a for profit activity. 

one of the main activities will be that all the users will be constantly voting on ideas, memes, articles, videos etc... like in social media, but they will "bet" on them with quadratic voting (no money from them). they will have a monthly budget so they will have to administer it. 

also people can "tip to earn". if they like a fanzine they can send a tip. but if you tip a project, and this project grows in reach, you earn from sponsors and from the fanzine's revenue.

there will be a lot of "sponsored pools" so if users vote on the favorite ideas, they will win a percentage of the pool, depending on how much they staked on it vs the rest. its like polymarket or jokerace (vote-and-earn v2). please research about it. 



every session will be run in a web app, the app has: -interactive storytelling -community can co-create and improve all the storytelling -it has an embedded community pool with USDC rewards for best ideas, executions, for even voting, governing, etc... -everything web3 is fully hidden.

<APP CHARACTERISTICS:>

The app also has voting functionality, to vote and give feedback, and to administer a "community pool" to reward all the fanzine creators and promoters.

The app has all the web3 functionality fully hidden:
-login with google
-no eth buying or anything
-voting and sharing resources is gasless (sponsored)
-there is an a.i. allocation co-pilot managing the funds

The app also has an a.i. moderator and capital allocation co-pilot. This tool moderates co-creation sessions, allocation decisions, governance.
