# Octant - Ethereum Stories

## Overview

We're collaborating with the Ethereum Foundation's Strategic Funding Coordination team to bring you **Epoch 9: Ethereum Stories**.

It's time to make Ethereum's narrative stronger. It's time for creatives to shine.

## Mission

This epoch, we're funding the journalists, storytellers, content creators, and researchers who've helped make Ethereum legible, credible, and engaging to audiences.

We're looking to fund high-impact marketing, educational, and journalistic content that pushes Ethereum forward.

## Vision

We want to see work that belongs in:
- **Classrooms** - Educational content that teaches Ethereum concepts
- **Newsrooms** - Journalistic pieces that inform the public
- **Dinner table conversations** - Content that makes Ethereum accessible to everyone

Think **Bill Nye for Ethereum**: smart, clear, impossible to ignore.

## Call to Action

If you've got a vision for how Ethereum's stories should be told, this is your stage.

Show us the campaign, series, or investigation you'd run to make Ethereum a part of everyday conversation.
