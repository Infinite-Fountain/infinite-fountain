# Gamechangers: Resilience Fanzine & Online Workshops

## POSSIBLE NAMES:
Impact Squads
Small Wins
Gamechangers Magazine

These names can co-exist. for examples "impact squads" can be the workshops. "small wins" the social media profile. "gamechangers" the formal publication (less normie friendly, more ETH focused)

## Intro
Gamechangers reimagines local media as a **fanzine + workshop ecosystem** that pays people to showcase their neighbors’ wins and fund quick wins everyone cares about—park cleanups, safety zines, price-watch reports. Each city has a paid **Coach** who runs lightweight online jams and monthly publishing sprints. Residents receive a fixed monthly **Pocket** of votes to back stories, guides, and tiny fix-projects; under the hood these votes route to **gasless quadratic budgets** and **sponsored pools**, so winners earn USDC and visibility without touching crypto. All web3 complexity stays invisible: Google login, no buys, frictionless payments. An **AI copilot** nudges creators with prompts, routes submissions, and generates recap reels. Normie hook: purpose, side-income, and local pride—delivered through transparent community budgets, not jargon.

## How It Works
1. **Recruit & Kickoff** — Coach spins up a city Crew; login is Google/social only.  
2. **Mini-Publishing Sprint (4 weeks)** — Weekly jam → publish local stories/guides.  
3. **Voting “Pocket”** — Every resident gets a monthly Pocket (gasless QV).  
4. **Sponsored Pools** — Votes route to transparent community budgets.  
5. **Payouts** — Top content and fix-projects earn USDC + featured placement.  
6. **Do & Document** — Crews execute funded “quick wins” and share proof.  
7. **AI Copilot** — Prompts, routes, recap reels, moderation.  
8. **Global Council** — Rest of the world votes for favorites, sponsors pools, and can earn based on team success.  
9. **Distribution** — Cross-posted shorts + city leaderboards for pride and healthy rivalry.  
10. **Replication** — “Coach Starter Kit” spins up the next neighborhood Crew.

## Roles
- **Coach (paid):** Hosts jams, curates, verifies proof-of-work, runs payouts, builds partnerships.  
- **Contributors:** Writers, videographers, mappers, data-checkers, fix-project leads.  
- **Residents (voters):** Spend the Pocket on what matters locally.

## Incentives & Budgets
- **USDC Micro-grants:** Content bounties + “Do” bounties for quick wins.  
- **Gasless QV:** The Pocket hides all crypto complexity.  
- **Visibility Rewards:** Leaderboards + “Hall of Wins” spread.  
- **Sponsor & Earn:** Global backers put money into teams; their return = *(share of total support) × (team’s performance vs rest)*. This makes global impact funding participatory and self-rewarding.
