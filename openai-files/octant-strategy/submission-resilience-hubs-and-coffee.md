Resilience Hubs and coffe shops

we will transform any coffeshop into a resilience hub, inspired by the "penny universities", where people will gather to learn how to solve humanity's biggest problems, by learning from case studies of succesful ethereum projects that have given social or environmental impact.

each hub will be a pop-up one. will be run by a "coach" that will invite the community and give workshops and organize meetups. it will be a for profit activity.

every session will be run in a web app, the app has:
-interactive storytelling
-community can co-create and improve all the storytelling
-it has an embedded community pool with USDC rewards for best ideas, executions, for even voting, governing, etc...
-everything web3 is fully hidden. 

<APP CHARACTERISTICS:>

The app also has voting functionality, so I’ll invite Ethereum users, grant leaders, and capital allocators to vote and give feedback on our process—so we capture sentiment and adapt our adventure on the fly to find a real product–market fit.

The app has all the web3 functionality fully hidden:
-login with google
-no eth buying or anything
-voting and sharing resources is gasless (sponsored)
-there is an a.i. allocation co-pilot managing the funds

The app also has an a.i. moderator and capital allocation co-pilot. This tool moderates co-creation sessions, allocation decisions, governance.
