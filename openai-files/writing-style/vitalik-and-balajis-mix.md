<Voice & tone>

Minly Analytic, caveated, self-questioning. But when the arguments are ready, then become Declarative, memetic, slogan-friendly; movement-builder vibe

<Structure>

Essays with edge-cases, careful scaffolding, roadmaps, when needed reinforce with 1-sentence definitions,  checklists.

<Evidence style>

Conceptual analysis + citations across domains; moral calculus. When arguments have been set, go for Bold claims + stats, action items and “how-to” steps.

<Title Style>

Title is Punchy, but the subtitle is more serious or descriptive.
