<blockchains are coordinative infrastructures>

Bitcoin has been referred to as a mycelial organism.5 Indeed, one of the core value
propositions of blockchain technology is based on the use of distributed network
architectures to serve as coordination
substrates for new forms of organizing.
This o! ers us a unique opportunity to
rethink many of the power asymmetries
we see in legacy systems, some of
which were the inspiration for blockchain
technology in the fi rst place. Every time
technology has opened a path toward
new coordinative infrastructures ≠ from
the printing press to the telegraph, to
the internet ≠ the world has experienced
massive shifts in geopolitical structure. Distributed ledger technology holds the same
potential for paradigmatic and socio≠ evolutionary shifts.6

<DAOs as Digital Fungi>

Mammals are more closely related to
fungi than to any other kingdom of life.
A key di! erence is that while mammals
internalize digestion by putting food
into their bodies, mycelia externalize
it by putting their bodies into the food,
breaking down and consuming the
environment around them. Some of the
nutrients are absorbed and transported
throughout the mycelial network to
other organisms, while other nutrients
are left to enrich the soil, enabling
new life to form and thrive. When a
mushroom feasts, it is a communal
banquet ≠ a public good for the whole ecology.
In contrast to ì mammalianî private corporations that enclose resources and
intellectual property within the ì boundaries of the fi rmî , decentralized autonomous
organizations (DAOs) could be considered the mycelia of the digital world; they
network amongst themselves and expand into emergent collaborations
to build shared value through open≠ source tooling and an ethos of
permissionless participation.

<Economic Resilience via Mesh Stability>

Imagine a future where community economies based on localized production are
connected in a vibrant tapestry of interwoven currencies. While a single mycelial
thread can be broken with ease, when woven together into a pluralistic mesh, they
have vastly greater strength and collective stability. This network infrastructure
of economic solidarity helps mitigate the community impacts of fi nancially-driven
boom and bust cycles that are so common in the global economy. It also increases
community resilience against other unpredictable shocks like pandemics or climate
disasters, which are all the more likely in an age of geopolitical uncertainty.
These interconnected economic networks reduce fi nancial risks for creatives and
entrepreneurs, for example by giving them access to a! ordable credit from their
community mutual credit systems. Re-localized supply chains prioritize the basic
needs of the many over the luxuries of the few, with MycoFi economic mechanisms
programmed to ensure that fi nance remains in service to the production of real value,
rather than the other way around. 

<Endosymbiotic Finance>

Imagine a future where the economic power of an organization comes from
its own internalized energy, rather than having to rely on outside sources of
extractive fi nance. In the same way that cells absorbed the power-generating
capabilities of mitochondria, MycoFi proposes endosymbiotic fi nance as the
process by which organizations internalize the capacity to produce and store
their own economic power, rather than having to submit to the high costs of
external fi nance provided by banks. This capability for endogenous credit
issuance enables organizations to have tighter feedback loops between their
evolving needs for capital and their ability to issue vouchers backed by their
own productive capacity. This process of organizational symbiogenesis will see
DAOs and other myco-organizations continue to “absorb” the useful functions
of fi nance, steadily reducing the power asymmetries that have allowed external
fi nance to become the proverbial “tail that wags the dog” of the real economy.

<Edge≠ based Intelligence>

The nature of fungal networks gives them an incredible capacity for adaptive
sense and response to stimuli within their environment. This gives them a knack for
emergent coordination
in fi nding food or
defending against
disease ≠ even cancer.
Rather than making
decisions with a
brain at the ì centerî
of the organism
and propagating
coordination signals
to the ì edgesî of
the network ≠ as you
might expect in a
hierarchical organization
≠ mushrooms show us
how advantageous it can be to process information from the edges of the network,
where new opportunities and threats
are most likely to arise.

<Wisdom of the Crowd>

Hyphae are constantly exploring
their environment without waiting for
direction from some central authority.
Every branch of a mycelial network is
fully empowered to search for food
in any direction, merging with other
hyphae along the way. The resulting
mesh then doubles down on e! ective
pathways while pruning those less
promising, leading to the emergent
growth of a network that is intimately
adapted to transporting resources
through its environment. 

<Quorum Sensing and Collective Coherence>

Fungi have also been studied for their incredible capacity for ì quorum sensingî , a
tactic for coordinating behavior using various biological and environmental cues.10
Given their structure as a distributed network of cellular threads, determining where
one individual begins and ends is no easy feat. Despite this lack of a decision≠ making
ì centerî , mycelia are capable of collectively deciding upon and achieving goals with
remarkable creativity and ingenuity. They have even demonstrated the ability to store
memory, such as the geographic location of past food sources.11 Their capacity to
store information improves their capability for emergent coordination.

<Adaptive, Breathing Myco-Organizations>

Imagine a future where DAOs have evolved to become emergent mycoorganizations, capable of collectively adapting to changes in their environment
through the real-time consensus of their constituents. Total Value Flowed has
replaced Total Value Locked as a key metric of ecosystemic health. Their dynamic
issuance18 token economies breathe with life, expanding and contracting in supply
to accommodate the emergent demand for the real value they produce. This not
only allows these myco-organizations to expand their capacity to fund emergent
collaborations, but it also allows them to contract safely and predictably, unlike the
zombifi ed institutions under late-stage capitalism that can only grow forever until
they collapse unpredictably.
