3 subtopics for an 8-minute TED-style talk

1) Ethereum as a Coordination Computer (why it matters)

Hook: real-world coordination failure (fees, gatekeepers, outages).

Core: shared rules, credible ownership, no single controller; coordinate at internet scale.

Payoff: sets the frame for why DeFi exists. 

2) DeFi: The Open, Always-On Financial Stack (what you can do today)

Contrast with TradFi: access barriers, hours, opacity, intermediaries.

Concrete actions: send/stream money, earn yield, borrow (with/without collateral), trade, insure—no gatekeeper.

Emphasize transparency and user control. 

3) From Crowds to Coherence: How Communities Decide and Fund

Tools: grants, bounties, streaming payments, quadratic funding, governable parameters.

Point: align incentives so broadly-valued work gets funded quickly and openly.

Close with a call-to-action: try a smart wallet, contribute to a small grant round, or join a DAO with clear bounties. 

Why these three?

They’re accessible to a broad audience (minimal jargon).

They deliver a clear arc: why → what → how.

Each has tangible examples from the DeFi piece to keep it grounded, while the coordination lens from the first piece explains why this matters now.
