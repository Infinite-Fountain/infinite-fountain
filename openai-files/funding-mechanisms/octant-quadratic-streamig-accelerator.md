# When $1.2 Billion in Grants Still Can't Keep Projects Alive


## The Problem: The Grants-to-Graveyard Pipeline

The crypto industry has perfected the art of throwing money at problems. Since 2018, over **$1.2 billion** has flowed through grant programs to promising projects building everything from developer tools to community platforms. Yet walk into any crypto conference and the conversation inevitably turns to the same existential question: **"How do we actually become sustainable?"**

Project after project burns through grant funding only to face the same cliff edge when the money runs out. The grants-to-graveyard pipeline has become so predictable that builders joke about "grant addiction" while secretly refreshing their email for the next funding announcement.

### The Fundamental Flaw

The fundamental flaw isn't the amount of money. It's the model itself. Traditional grants operate like charity:

- Write a compelling application
- Receive a lump sum
- Spend it down
- Repeat the cycle

**Key Issues:**
- No ongoing relationship
- No accountability mechanism
- No path to self-sufficiency
- Projects optimize for proposal writing rather than revenue generation
- Donors make one-time contributions with zero visibility into actual impact

## The Solution: Octant's Two-Layer Approach

When Octant decided to tackle builder sustainability, they tried something different. Instead of just distributing more money, they built a two-layer experiment that combined:

1. **Intensive business development**
2. **Streaming Quadratic Funding (SQF)**

The results from their four-week pilot program suggest that the problem isn't builders lacking good ideas or sufficient capital. It's lacking the right support structure and funding flexibility to actually succeed.

## Layer 1: The Accelerator That Actually Accelerated

### Traditional Accelerator Problems

Most crypto accelerators follow the same playbook:
- Weekly mentorship calls
- Demo day presentations
- Vague promises of "network access"

### Octant's Different Approach

Octant designed their four-week program around a simple thesis: **builders don't need more theory, they need to generate revenue immediately.**

**Program Structure:**
- 94% attendance rates across 34 sessions
- Speakers included: @ethereum, @jokerace_io, @aztecnetwork, @phantom, @hypepartners, @dragonflyvc, @Pizza_DAO
- Every session had to translate into measurable business outcomes within days

### Results: Action Over Education

**Across 14 projects, participants achieved:**
- **$371,000+** in revenue
- **90,445** new users onboarded
- **$800,000** sales pipeline
- All within four weeks

#### Case Study 1: WebHash
- **Before**: Pre-revenue
- **After**: $15,000 in subscription sales
- **Growth**: 4,190 new signups, 5,072 followers
- **Key Innovation**: Launched SaaS subscription feature and integrated DNS functionality specifically for the accelerator

#### Case Study 2: LottoPGF
- **Revenue Generated**: $300,000
- **User Engagement**: 30,000+ mints
- **Innovation**: Turned public goods funding into a lottery mechanism
- **Testing**: 16,000 players tested their permissionless lottery system
- **Partnerships**: Events like ReFi Amsterdam and Public Goods Day

## Layer 2: Streaming Quadratic Funding (SQF)

### Traditional Quadratic Funding Problems

Traditional quadratic funding rounds operate like political campaigns:
- Intense two-week sprints
- Projects compete for attention
- Donors make one-time contributions
- Matching funds distributed based on snapshots
- **Winner-take-all system** that rewards marketing ability over sustained execution
- **Zero mechanism for course correction**

### How SQF Changes Everything

**Streaming Quadratic Funding (SQF)** flips this dynamic entirely:

- **Ongoing streams** instead of one-time donations
- **Real-time adjustments** based on project performance
- **Continuous matching algorithm** that updates allocations
- **Accountability mechanism**: donors can stop streams if projects underperform

**Key Innovation**: If a project abandons development or fails to deliver, donors can literally take their funding back by stopping their streams.

## Pilot Results and Validation

### Donor Response
- Donors appreciated the flexibility and transparency of recurring funding
- Projects gained predictable revenue streams for sustainable operations

### Quantitative Results

**TLDR in Numbers:**
- **Total donations**: 30.18 ETH
  - 15 ETH from Octant
  - 15.18 ETH from the community
- **Unique donors**: 3,788
- **Projects with 2+ ETH in matching funds**: 5
- **External validation**: Public Nouns contributed 2.5 ETH to extend the round an additional month

### Success Story: Karma GAP

**Karma GAP** (grant accountability platform) results:
- **60% increase** in engagement
- **1,000 attestations** created
- **380 users** engaged
- **Perfect alignment**: Streaming model supports ongoing accountability through continuous community feedback rather than quarterly reports that nobody reads

## Conclusion

The combination of intensive business development and Streaming Quadratic Funding demonstrates that the problem isn't insufficient funding or lack of good ideas. It's the need for:

1. **Immediate revenue focus** in accelerator programs
2. **Ongoing accountability** through streaming funding
3. **Flexible funding mechanisms** that adapt to project performance
4. **Real-time community feedback** instead of static grant cycles

This approach provides a sustainable path forward for crypto projects beyond the traditional grants-to-graveyard pipeline.
