Slide 1 — Title & Hook
**we need a different name and slogan (give me ideas**
 10-minute micro-collabs to help Ethereum researchers and make Ethereum better
The pitch: “This could be the easiest $20 USDC you’ll make **today**: spend 10 minutes unblocking a fellow researcher. If you don’t win, Ethereum wins.”


For researchers, by researchers—  *** xxxxx into shared momentum. ***


Outcome: faster problem-solving, richer idea flow, *** gamified xxxx***


Slide 2 — The Problem & Opportunity

Let’s move away form a siloed approach and work as a team; good ideas are being wasted


it’s normally hard to ask for help, but we are the coordination champions
We will unlock peer-to-peer help.


On-chain attestations let impact travel across grants/retro funding ecosystems.


Slide 3 — The Product (Web App) & Flow

We will post a “Challenge” every 2-3 days ** what cadence sounds more appealing ? *** 


Up to 10 people will invest 10 minutes to suggest the best unblocker, ** 2 more ideas to put alongside unblocker to explain more types of contributions**.
All ideas are anonymous so they have the same chance to get picked.


The researcher will pick his favorite idea, and that idea will win


**optional line** The rest of the players will receive points (given by the researcher). The points will be used at the end of the month to cash in a $100 usdc bonus prize.


Wisdom Council (optional): reviews edge cases & ensures fairness. **reframe it so it sounds like fun to read**


** deleted the flow, it you think we need it please let me know **


Promise
“10 minutes, 10 entrants, 10% ** chance to win **, $20 usdc every ** xxx *** days.”


If you don’t win, your idea still builds your reputation and helps Ethereum.


Slide 4 — Mechanism & Fairness

$20 winner per Challenge 


Instant payout to your wallet 


**(anything else?)**



One submission per Challenge; reveal after deadline to reduce idea sniping.


Simple rubric (e.g., Usefulness 60%, Feasibility 20%, Clarity 20%).


Council tie-breaks; transparent audit log of selections & payouts.








Slide 6 — Pilot Plan, KPIs, Timeline, Budget
Pilot Scope (4 weeks)
10 collaborators ( cohort), 2–3 Challenges each/week.


**200 usdc** will be distributed in this alpha test (all during September, 1 month )




Time-to-decision: median < 3 days from Challenge post to winner chosen.






FAQ (drop on final slide or appendix)
1) Why $20? Isn’t that tiny?
 It’s a micro-bounty to catalyze quick, high-leverage ideas. The bigger payoff is reputation + attestations that unlock larger funding later. You can scale prize sizes or add runner-up tips as data comes in.
Retroactive possibility
The bonus pool today is 100 usdc, but after we finish the experiment, we will do a tiny crowdfunding, showcasing a video recap with our findings, our collaborative spirit, value for ethereum, and we will ask for people to donate retroactively to the bonus pool ** maybe call it retroactive bonus pool** and the money will be split automatically and in proportion of the points of each collaborator.

3) Who picks the winner?
 Default: the Researcher. If conflict or uncertainty, the Wisdom Council adjudicates using the rubric; decisions and rationales are logged. I want to keep this first experiment as simple as possible.
4) How are payouts sent?
 USDC on the L2 network you choose (optimism, celo, base, arbitrum). 

5) What about IP/credit?
Everything will be copyleft (open source). 
6) Can people collude or game the system?
I am sure they can ! Let’s keep an eye on how it evolvces and design guardrails as we advance and for future iterations.
8) Is this just another bounty board?
 No—this is time-boxed, micro-collab focused, with a hard cap of 10 entrants and a 10-minute ask. It optimizes for velocity and unblockers, not full deliverables.
9) What if no submission is good?
 The researcher can withhold the prize. Unawarded funds go the the retroactive bonus pool.
10) What does success look like?
 More unblocked research, faster iteration cycles, visible contributor reputations, and a reusable impact graph that retro funders can pay from.
We will also publish a 5 min video recap of the whole experience, hopefully providing a lot of valuable insights from the research perspective, but also from the mechanism perspective. 

12) How do we scale?
** lets think this answer, very important **
