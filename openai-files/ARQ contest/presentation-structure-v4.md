Slide 1 — Title & Hook

(Working name) Infinite Fountain / Rotating Mutual Aid / Allo Research micro-collabs intro

10 minutes. 10 researchers. and Ethereum Wins.


-


-Spend 10 min helping a fellow researcher. 
-He selects the best idea and that idea instantly wins. 
-There is a $20 usdc prize, only 10 participants, 10% change of winning.
-If too many good ideas, the researcher or the council can send a tip to runnerups.
-And even if you don’t win, "Ethereum wins".

Rotating needs → shared momentum.

Unlocking small breakthroughs that will accelerate our research, and ripple across the entire Ethereum ecosystem.

Slide 2 — We are the coordination champions

Siloed research = wasted ideas; hard to ask for help, harder to synthesize.

We’re coordination champions: create a tiny, time-boxed lane for help.

Our solution: a low-friction prosocial game that rotates help and rewards reciprocity.

Rotating needs, shared momentum.

faster unblockings, richer idea flow, lightweight gamification.

Slide 3 — How It Works (tiny flow)

we will post a challenge 2 times per week, during 1 month

we will be constantly rotating researcher's needs so we get to help everybody

Up to 10 people claim a slot and spend 10 minutes to submit.

Prize per Challenge: $20 USDC

Submissions are anonymous until reveal; one entry per person.

The Researcher selects the winner; ARQ Council resolves ties.

Instant payout to winner’s wallet. 

Researcher and ARQ Council can send a “tip” (e.g., $1–$5) to the winner or to runner-ups.

And even if you don't win... Ethereum wins.

Slide 4 — Pilot & Budget 

The program will run 1 month (during September)

Cohort: 10 trusted collaborators; rotating researcher needs.

Cadence: 2 challenges per week, $20 usd per challenge, 1 month = $160 usdc in instant prizes

Budget: 260 USDC total = 160 USDC instant prizes + 100 USDC Retroactive Rewards Pool (see next slide)

the 260 usdc are already allocated in the ARQ Contest's smart contract:

Slide 5 - Points & Retroactive Rewards


We wan to reward helpful contributions across the month.

Each challenge, aside from giving the instant prize, the researcher will allocate points to all the collaborators.

At month-end, the Retroactive Rewards Pool is distributed proportional to their points.

-


Slide 7 — Outcomes and Deliverables


Deliverable: A 5-minute public recap video of the experiment for Allo-Capital to learn from and to support the retroactive rewards pool.

But overrall, what we will win is:
-Faster Unblockings & Richer Idea Flow
-Will create a Reciprocal Network
-Richer findings means a richer Ethereum ecosystem, and hopefully richer retroactive rewards for the team

-And even if we don't win, Ethereum wins.

FAQ (append to deck)

How do submissions work?
They’re open answers guided by an AI moderator:

Step 1: Moderator posts an initial prompt; user answers.

Step 2: Moderator asks ~6 follow-ups to enrich the idea.

Step 3: The bot stitches both parts into a draft submission; user can edit before sending.
(Kept here to avoid crowding the main deck.)

Who picks the winner? What if there’s disagreement?
The Researcher picks. ARQ Council serves as a tie-breaker and fairness steward.

Can runner-ups get rewarded?
Yes. Researcher and ARQ Council can tip anyone at any time (runner-ups or winner) to recognize near-misses or exceptional help.


How are payouts sent?
USDC on Optimism, Celo, or Base (whichever is cheapest at time of payout).

What about IP/credit?
All contributions are copyleft/open source.

What if no submission is good?
The researcher can withhold the prize; unawarded funds roll into the retro pool.

Retroactive Rewards Pool — Split Rule (simple & legible)
(Exactly as before)

30% goes directly to the latest cohort
70% funds the next cohort(s)

(if the crowdfunding is below $300 usd, we will split 50-50)
