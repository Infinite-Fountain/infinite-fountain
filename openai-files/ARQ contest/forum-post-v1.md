# Infinite Fountain - Rotating Mutual Aid - Allo Research Quest

A low-friction mutual-aid game that rotates help, rewards reciprocity, unlocks collective breakthroughs, and accelerates Ethereum research.

---

## 10 minutes. 10 collaborators. A stronger Allo Research Quest.

Spend 10 minutes helping a fellow researcher.

The researcher selects the best idea and that idea instantly wins $20 USDC (directly to their wallet).

Then we rotate the spotlight to the next researcher. Rotating needs → shared momentum.

Only 10 participants; 10% chance of winning.

If there are too many good ideas, the researcher (or the ARQ council) can send extra tips to the winner and/or runner-ups.

And even if you don't win, Ethereum and Allo Research Quest wins.

## We'll become coordination champions:

In research, the obstacles aren't just technical—they're social. It's hard to ask for help, harder to synthesize across silos, and easiest of all to quietly stall. That's coordination failure in slow motion.

We are creating a small contest to turn siloed insights into shared momentum. We are going to unblock small breakthroughs that will accelerate our research and ripple across the Ethereum and Allo ecosystems.

- Tiny unblocks are a public good.
- Rotation builds reciprocity and builds momentum.

## How It Works:

Everything will be played inside the Infinite Fountain app.

We will post a challenge 2 times per week for 1 month.

Each challenge is an opportunity to help a fellow researcher.

We'll constantly rotate researchers so we get to help everybody.

Up to 10 people claim a slot and spend 10 minutes to submit.

Prize per challenge: $20 USDC.

The researcher selects the winner; ARQ Council resolves ties.

Submissions are anonymous until reveal; one entry per person.

Instant payout to winner's wallet.

Researcher and ARQ Council can send a "tip" (e.g., $1–$5) to the winner or to runner-ups.

And even if you don't win... Ethereum and Allo Research Quest wins.

### Points & Retroactive Rewards

We want to reward helpful contributions throughout the month.

Each challenge, aside from giving the instant prize, the researcher will allocate points to all the collaborators.

At month-end, the Retroactive Rewards Pool is distributed proportional to their points.

## Dates & Budget

Program length: 1 month (starting September 1st)

Cohort: 10 trusted collaborators; rotating researcher needs

Cadence: 2 challenges per week, $20 USD per challenge → 1 month = $160 USDC in instant prizes

Budget: 260 USDC total = 160 USDC instant prizes + 100 USDC Retroactive Rewards Pool

The $260 USDC have already been allocated into the ARQ InfiniteFountain smart contract:

## Outcomes & Deliverables

I will create a 5-minute public recap video of the experiment. I want the Allo-Capital members to learn from our experiment, and will also use this video to crowdfund and ask for support towards the retroactive rewards pool.

But overall, what we will win is:

- **Faster Unblockings & Richer Idea Flow**
- **Will create a Reciprocal Network**
- **Richer findings mean a richer Ethereum ecosystem, and hopefully richer retroactive rewards for the team**

This is an experiment. There are a lot of things that have not been defined, others will constantly change/evolve, but I will put all my heart into making this a very valuable experience for the whole ARQ cohort.

Check out the full document. I will be posting FAQ, video walkthroughs, and the latest information:
