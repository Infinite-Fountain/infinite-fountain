Slide 1 — Title & Hook

(Working name) Infinite Fountain / Rotating Mutual Aid / Allo Research micro-collabs intro

5-minute micro-collabs to help Ethereum researchers


-Spend 5 min helping a fellow researcher. 
-He selects the best idea and that idea instantly wins. 
-There is a $20 usdc prize, only 10 participants, 10% change of winning.
-If too many good ideas, the researcher or the council can send a tip to runnerups.
-And even if you don’t win, "Ethereum wins" TM.

Slide 2 — We are the coordination champions

Siloed research = wasted ideas; hard to ask for help, harder to synthesize.

We’re coordination champions: create a tiny, time-boxed lane for help.

Rotating needs, shared momentum.
faster unblockings, richer idea flow, lightweight gamification.

-


Slide 3 — How It Works (tiny flow)

we will post a challenge 2 times per week, during 1 month

we will be constantly rotating researcher's needs so we get to help everybody

Up to 10 people claim a slot and spend 5 minutes to submit.

Submissions are anonymous until reveal; one entry per person.

The Researcher selects the winner; ARQ Council resolves ties.

Instant payout to winner’s wallet. (Networks: Optimism, Celo, Base)

-


Slide 4 — Mechanics, Fairness & Tips

Prize per Challenge: $10–$20 USDC (see plan next slide).

New: Researcher and ARQ Council can send a “tip” (e.g., $1–$5) to any runner-up—or even the winner—at any time.

Why it helps: recognizes near-misses, keeps effort high, feels fair.

Rubric: Usefulness 60% · Feasibility 20% · Clarity 20%.

Reveal after deadline to reduce idea-sniping.

License: Copyleft/open source for all submissions.

Slide 5 — Pilot Plan & Budget 

Cohort: 10 trusted collaborators; rotating researcher needs.

Cadence: 2 challenges per week 

Budget: 260 USDC total

Recommended split: 160 USDC instant prizes + 100 USDC Retroactive Rewards Pool

Tips can be paid from leftover prize budget or external donations.

Payouts: USDC on Optimism, Celo, or Base (choose cheapest at run-time).

Slide 6 - Points & Retroactive Rewards

** we need to explain how this pool works, mainly from the researchers perspective, how it brings extra opportunities at the end **



Participants earn points per challenge (winner + runner-ups via rubric).

At month-end, the Retroactive Rewards Pool is distributed proportional to their points.

Slide 7 — Deliverables



Deliverable: A 5-minute public recap video of the experiment for Allo-Capital to learn from and to support the retroactive rewards pool.

FAQ (append to deck)

How do submissions work?
They’re open answers guided by an AI moderator:

Step 1: Moderator posts an initial prompt; user answers.

Step 2: Moderator asks ~6 follow-ups to enrich the idea.

Step 3: The bot stitches both parts into a draft submission; user can edit before sending.
(Kept here to avoid crowding the main deck.)

Who picks the winner? What if there’s disagreement?
The Researcher picks. ARQ Council serves as a tie-breaker and fairness steward.

Can runner-ups get rewarded?
Yes. Researcher and ARQ Council can tip anyone at any time (runner-ups or winner) to recognize near-misses or exceptional help.


How are payouts sent?
USDC on Optimism, Celo, or Base (whichever is cheapest at time of payout).

What about IP/credit?
All contributions are copyleft/open source.

What if no submission is good?
The researcher can withhold the prize; unawarded funds roll into the retro pool.
