Slide 1 — Title & Hook

App: Infinite Fountain 
Tool: Rotating Mutual Aid 
Community: Allo Research Quest (ARQ)

A low-friction mutual-aid game that rotates help, rewards reciprocity, unlocks xxx and accelerates Ethereum research.

10 minutes. 10 //(how can we name the players? they are not all researchers, collaborators? players?)//. 10 fresh angles... a stronger Allo Research Quest.


-Spend 10 min helping a fellow researcher. 
-The researcher selects the best idea and that idea instantly wins $20 usdc (directly to his wallet). 
-then we rotate the spotlight to the next researcher. Rotating needs → shared momentum.
-Only 10 participants, 10% change of winning.
-If too many good ideas, the researcher (or the ARQ council) can send extra tips to the winner and/or runnerups.
-And even if you don’t win, Ethereum and "Allo Research Quest" wins.


We are creating a small contest to turn siloed insights into shared momentum.

We are going to unblock small breakthroughs that will accelerate our research, and ripple across the entire Ethereum ecosystem.

Slide 2 — We are the coordination champions

In research, the obstacles aren’t just technical—they’re social. It’s hard to ask for help, harder to synthesize across silos, and easiest of all to quietly stall. That’s coordination failure in slow motion.


We'll become coordination champions: 

-Tiny unblocks are a public good
-Rotation builds reciprocity and builds momentum



-


Slide 3 — How It Works:

We will post a challenge 2 times per week, during 1 month

Each challenge is an opportunity to help a fellow researcher

We'll constantly rotate researcher so we get to help everybody

Up to 10 people claim a slot and spend 10 minutes to submit.

Prize per Challenge: $20 USDC

The Researcher selects the winner; ARQ Council resolves ties.

Submissions are anonymous until reveal; one entry per person.

Instant payout to winner’s wallet. 

Researcher and ARQ Council can send a “tip” (e.g., $1–$5) to the winner or to runner-ups.

And even if you don't win... Ethereum and "Allo Research Quest" wins

Slide 4 - Points & Retroactive Rewards


We wan to reward helpful contributions across the month.

Each challenge, aside from giving the instant prize, the researcher will allocate points to all the collaborators.

At month-end, the Retroactive Rewards Pool is distributed proportional to their points.

Slide 5 — Pilot & Budget 

The program will run 1 month (during September)

Cohort: 10 trusted collaborators; rotating researcher needs.

Cadence: 2 challenges per week, $20 usd per challenge, 1 month = $160 usdc in instant prizes

Budget: 260 USDC total = 160 USDC instant prizes + 100 USDC Retroactive Rewards Pool 

the $260 usdc have been already allocated into the "ARQ InfiniteFountain smart contract":

Slide 7 — Outcomes and Deliverables


Deliverable: We will create a 5-minute public recap video of the experiment. We want the Allo-Capital members to learn from our experiment and we will also use this to crowdfund and ask for support towards the "retroactive rewards pool".

But overrall, what we will win is:
-Faster Unblockings & Richer Idea Flow
-Will create a Reciprocal Network
-Richer findings means a richer Ethereum ecosystem, and hopefully richer retroactive rewards for the team

-And even if we don't win, Ethereum and "Allo Research Quest" wins.

FAQ (append to deck)

How do submissions work?
They’re open answers guided by an AI moderator:

Step 1: Moderator posts an initial prompt; user answers.

Step 2: Moderator asks ~6 follow-ups to enrich the idea.

Step 3: The bot stitches both parts into a draft submission; user can edit before sending.
(Kept here to avoid crowding the main deck.)

Who picks the winner? What if there’s disagreement?
The Researcher picks. ARQ Council serves as a tie-breaker and fairness steward.

Can runner-ups get rewarded?
Yes. Researcher and ARQ Council can tip anyone at any time (runner-ups or winner) to recognize near-misses or exceptional help.


How are payouts sent?
USDC on Optimism, Celo, or Base (whichever is cheapest at time of payout).

What about IP/credit?
All contributions are copyleft/open source.

What if no submission is good?
The researcher can withhold the prize; unawarded funds roll into the retro pool.

Retroactive Rewards Pool — Split Rule (simple & legible)
(Exactly as before)

30% goes directly to the latest cohort
70% funds the next cohort(s)

(if the crowdfunding is below $300 usd, we will split 50-50)
